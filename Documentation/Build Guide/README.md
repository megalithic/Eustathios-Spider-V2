## INTRODUCTION

The Eustathios V2 (designed by [Eric Lien](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+EricLiensMind/posts)) is the latest version of [Jason Smith's](https://plus.google.com/103009815307828556107/posts) original Estathios.
There is a deeper history to this variant, that I won't go into here, but I
highly recommend visiting our [Ingentis, HercuLien and Eustathios Builders Google+ Community](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/108524206628971601859), fully dedicated to the plethora
of the Eustathios and other variants.

## TOOLS

Seeing as how this is a 3D printer design based upon an Ultimaker-style gantry
system, we'll be using a lot of aluminum extrusion pieces, so a drill or drill
press and miter saw  or hand saw for aluminum may be necessary in the event you
don't buy extrusions pre-cut and pre-drilled (that hopefully shouldn't be
necessary, as the BOM referenced above includes the part numbers for pre-cut
and pre-drilled extrusions).

Other tools you'll want to have on hand:

* 2.5mm Hex Wrench
* 3mm Hex Wrench
* Bubble Level (for leveling the Z Gantry)
* Multimeter
* Marker
* Masking tape
* Drill
* 1mm drill bit or equivalent imperial standard bit (This is just used for drilling pilot holes so it doesn't have to be precise but needs to be small enough to fit in the drill guide)
* 5mm drill bit
* 8mm drill bit
* 7/8" drill bit
* 1/2" End mill

## PARTS RUNDOWN

This prescribed build has some rather nice components, however, they can be
substituted based upon your preferences and budget.

The following list outlines some of those options.

* Extruder: the BOM suggests Eric's own design, dubbed the HercStruder
(used in his [HercuLien](https://github.com/eclsnowman/HercuLien) design).
The promising and impressive [BondTech V2](http://www.bondtech.se/)
(which I have decided to use) could be substituted.

* Controller: the BOM suggests the Azteeg X5 Mini, however, the Smoothieboard 5xc
(which I have decided to use) could be substituted.

* LCD: the BOM suggests the Viki2 LCD, however, you could easily substitute the
standard LCDs used on any number of RepRap builds.

The list goes on, even down to the color and type of extrusion used. Since this
is a true DIY build, e.g., not a kit and not pre-built, it allows for a greater
amount of customization.
